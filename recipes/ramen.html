  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h4>COOK THE CHICKEN:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until
      the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for
      another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li>
    <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from
      the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>MAKE THE RAMEN BROTH:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few
      minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and <a
        href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Eden+Foods+Mirin%2C+Rice+Cooking+Wine%2C+10.1+FL+oz+-+300ml&linkCode=gg3&linkId=2722e62cb8244646df21f539df7340a8&tag=forkniswo-20"
        target="_blank">mirin</a>, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.</li>
    <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the
      dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>MAKE THE SOFT-BOILED EGGS:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the
      fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft,
      but set-up yolk).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop
      the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell
      and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>ASSEMBLE THE RAMEN BOWLS:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the
      eggs finish cooking, add the <a

        target="_blank">ramen noodles</a> to the boiling water.</li>
    <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the
      ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!</li>
