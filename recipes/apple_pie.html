      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h4>PREPARE THE ALL-BUTTER PIE CRUST:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the butter into quarter-inch cubes. Place the butter in the freezer for at least ten minutes or until
          ready
          to use.</li>
        <li>Pulse together the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor, once or twice until just combined. Add the
          butter
          cubes to the flour mixture and pulse a few times until the butter is evenly distributed, with the largest
          butter
          bits about the size of large peas.</li>
        <li>Add the vinegar and ice water, pulsing once or twice between each tablespoon addition. The dough is ready
          when
          it appears crumbly, but will easily hold together when pinched between two fingers. It's better to err on the
          side
          of a slightly wetter dough than too dry - you can always add a bit more flour when you're rolling.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured work surface and divide into two halves. Form each half
          into a
          round disk, working quickly and being careful not to over-handle the dough.</li>
        <li>Wrap each disk tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes prior to rolling it
          out.
          The pastry may be made in advance and stored for up to a day in the refrigerator or - if wrapped very tightly
          in
          plastic wrap - about a month in the freezer.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>HOW TO MAKE YOUR CLASSIC APPLE PIE:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the bottom crust:</strong> Remove one disk of dough from the fridge. Wait about 5 minutes
          for
          the dough to warm slightly and become pliable. Meanwhile, generously butter the pie pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in the center of a clean, lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin - I prefer to
          use a
          French (tapered) rolling pin - start in the center of the disk, and roll outwards, with firm but gentle
          pressure.
          Turn the dough and continue rolling towards the edges. As you work, don't be afraid to sprinkle additional
          flour
          on top of the dough and underneath, as well as on the rolling pin to avoid sticking.</li>
        <li>Continue rolling until the dough is about 2-inches larger in diameter than your pie pan and about 1/8-inch
          thick. As the dough gets larger, be careful to apply even pressure with the rolling pin across the entire
          surface
          of the dough.</li>
        <li>Gently transfer the dough to your buttered pie pan, being careful not to pull or tear the dough. Use your
          fingers to gently fit the dough against the sides and bottom of the pan. Using kitchen shears, trim the
          overhanging dough, leaving about an inch of excess (from the edge of the pan). Place in the fridge while you
          prepare the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the apple filling:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, stir together the brown sugar, sugar, <a
            href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Bob%27s+Red+Mill+Arrowroot+Starch+%2F+Flour%2C+16+Ounce+%28Pack+of+1%29&linkCode=gg3&linkId=a192e59751377b68f33fb953cc9ed6a9&tag=forkniswo-20&ref=as_li_ss_tl"
            target="_blank">arrowroot starch</a>, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and cardamom, until combined. Toss
          with
          the sliced apples. Drizzle with the vanilla, and zest, if using. Set aside while you roll out the top crust
          (about
          10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the top crust:</strong> Roll the second disk of dough out as directed above, to about
          10-inches
          in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Use a pastry cutter, sharp knife or pizza wheel to cut out 8-10 equal-width
          strips
          for a traditional woven lattice top.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the pie:</strong> Remove the bottom crust from the refrigerator and sprinkle with 1 tsp
          each
          sugar and flour. Fill with the apple mixture. Weave your lattice crust across the pie, tuck the ends under,
          and
          crimp the edges. Place the pie in the freezer to chill for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the pie:</strong> Preheat the oven to 400℉. Brush the pie pastry with the egg wash, being
          careful
          not to drag any of the fruit filling onto the pastry (it will burn). Sprinkle with <a
            href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Demerara+Baking+Sugar%2C+16+Oz%2C+16+Oz&linkCode=gg3&linkId=b2436046b59e87fa461bf532bc180e7f&tag=forkniswo-20&ref=as_li_ss_tl"
            target="_blank">Demerara sugar</a> (if using).</li>
        <li>Place the pie on a nonstick or <a

            target="_blank">parchment paper</a> lined rimmed sheet pan to catch any drips. Bake for 20-25 minutes on the
          bottom rack of the oven until the crust is beginning to turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the oven temperature down to 375℉, move the pie to the middle rack, and bake for an additional 30-40
          minutes until the filling is bubbly and the pie is golden brown and cooked through. Use a pie crust shield or
          aluminum foil tent as necessary to prevent the crust from burning.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and let sit on a baking rack to cool for at least an hour before slicing. It
          will
          take a few hours to completely cool to room-temperature and fully set up.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or at room temperature with big scoops of vanilla ice cream. Will keep for a day at room
          temperature
          or 3-4 days in the refrigerator.</li>
